Tic-Tac-Toe Python Game
This is a simple implementation of the classic Tic-Tac-Toe game in Python. The code is designed to be easy to read and understand, and it can be used as a learning resource for beginners who want to improve their Python skills.

Getting Started
To run the game, you need to have Python 3 installed on your computer. You can download Python 3 from the official website.

Once you have Python 3 installed, you can clone this repository to your computer using Git:

git clone https://github.com/AdwitiyaMathur/tic-tac-toe-python.git
Alternatively, you can download the repository as a ZIP file and extract it to a folder on your computer.

Playing the Game
To play the game, open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the folder where you cloned or extracted the repository. Then, run the tic_tac_toe.py script using Python:

python tic_tac_toe.py


The game will start and display an empty game board, with the cells numbered from 0 to 8:


  0 | 1 | 2
 -----------
  3 | 4 | 5
 -----------
  6 | 7 | 8
  
  
To make a move, type the number of the cell you want to mark and press Enter. The game will validate your input and mark the cell with the symbol of the current player (either X or O). The game will then switch to the other player, and the updated game board will be displayed.

The game will continue until one player wins by marking three cells in a row, or until all cells are marked and there is no winner (a tie).
